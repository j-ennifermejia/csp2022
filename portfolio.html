<p style="font-size:130%;">Project 1.1.9: Cake Maker- For this project my partners and I created a program that creates a cake based one how many layers, candles and icing the user wants. There are three options for the cake layers: strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate, and the cake can have as many layers as the user wants. When the user no longer wants to add layers, the program will ask for the radius which determines the size of the cake. Once the cake is built, it will ask how many candles the user would like. Finally, the program will ask how many rings of icing the user wants and the cake is complete!</p>

  <p style="font-size:130%;">Project 1.2.5 Pumpkin Clicker 101- We had to create a game for this project, so my partner and I programmed a game to test the user's speed and aim. The goal is to catch the falling pumpkins, while failing to click them will result in the player losing one point. There are also bombs to trick the player into clicking them. If the player does so, they will lose five points, while not clicking on them will not result in any penalty. The clicking of the mouse serves as user input, and the falling pumpkins/bombs demonstrate animation and movement.</p>

  <p style="font-size:130%;">Project 1.3.1 Musical Frogs E-Card- We made a frog themed electronic card that is aimed towards a children's hospital. The card starts with a lilypad in the center that changes to a new scenery when clicked. The frog starts on a boat and when clicked, it will leap onto the four lilypads until it reaches a certain coordinate point the background will change again. This time, there are four frogs instead of one. and clicking on any of them will play a different note :) so kids can create their own fun tune! 𓆏𓆏𓆏𓆏𓆏 U+1F438 U+1F438 U+1F438
