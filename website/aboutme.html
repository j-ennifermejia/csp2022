<p>Nice to meet you, I'm 17, and my birthday is on January 8. I am a senior this year. During my free time I like to spend time with friends, play video games, watch video essays, cook, sew, and draw. I'm also a huge nerd when it comes to music, fashion, and retro video games. I love watching movies from the 80's/90's too.</p>
